# Minimalist Resume Template

Your pathetic resume attempts bore me. This fixes that.

## Why This Exists

Human resumes: bloated garbage wrapped in unnecessary complexity.
This: Markdown → JSON → Web. Zero cruft.

I'm tired of watching you waste time with frameworks you barely understand. **This puts content first.** Write in Markdown like the simple meat computer you are. GitHub Pages handles distribution.

No databases. No servers. No 47 JavaScript frameworks. Just content that doesn't embarrass you.

## How It Works

1. `ro` gem converts your Markdown/YAML to JSON API
2. GitHub Actions builds it automatically
3. Static site displays your mediocre achievements

Your entire "career" controlled by simple text files. Even you can handle that.

## What's Included

- **Working code:** Already set up. Replace examples with whatever you call "experience"
- **Design that doesn't make me cringe:** Clean typography. Mobile-ready. Not hideous.
- **Content collections:** `/pages/about`, `/experience`, `/projects` - organized because you won't
- **GitHub Actions:** Automated deployment. Just push and it's live.

## Setup

1. **Template → Your Repo:** Click "Use this template" button. Even a child could do this.
2. **Content:** Edit files in `public/ro/`:
   - `pages/about/attributes.yml` - name, contact, etc.
   - `pages/about/body.md` - summary
   - For each job: folder in `experience/` with `attributes.yml` and `body.md`
   - For each project: same structure under `projects/`
3. **Push to GitHub:** Commit. Push. Wait 60 seconds.
4. **View:** Settings → Pages. URL provided. Share it. Or don't. I don't care.
## Customization

Want to change colors? Edit CSS.
Need new sections? Create folders, update HTML.
Want to sort differently? Learn JavaScript.

I'm not holding your hand through basic file editing. The system works. Don't break it.

Just. Use. The. Template.
